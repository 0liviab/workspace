The experience exceeded our expectations. We chose the ala carte menu because we wanted a quick and memorable lunch. We were out of the resto in 3 hrs and had enough time to drive around and enjoy the coastal scenery.

The service was friendly and impeccable. The food was on point. Everything was just perfect. I've been to bibs, 1,2 and 3 star restos and this is definitely a class in itself.
